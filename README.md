# IUT Laravel
This repository is a starter giving you all tools you need to help you build your application with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and PHP.

> Since this repository is for learning purpose, it is **not production ready**

## Requirements
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with the [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) plugin
- Git

### Windows Requirements
- [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/windows/wsl/install)
- Ubuntu 24.04 installed from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nz3klhxdjp5?hl=fr-fr&gl=FR)
- [Optional] [Windows Terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n0dx20hk701?hl=fr-FR&gl=FR)

## Launch
### Reset the Git
Create a project named <TO_REPLACE> in your own GitHub then clone this one.

```shell
git clone donovanbroquin/iut-laravel
```

> On Windows, please make sure to clone this repository in the WSL 2 Ubuntu 24.04 distro.

Then, delete the hidden `.git` directory in the cloned repository root and follow the `or create a new repository on the command line` section showed by GitHub **excluding** the **first line** and updating the `git add README.md` line to be `git add .` .

### Clean the project
Housekeeping time.

Delete the following files and directories
- .github
- screenshots
- dockerfile

### Start the environment
You can now start the environment using Docker Compose with the following command line from the project root

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

> This command line **MUST** be launched from your host using the Visual Studio Code **integrated terminal**

> **Windows users**: open the project using the WSL extension @todo > make video

Once the command has been launched, you should see something similar in your terminal.

Also, a `laravel` directory should be present in the project tree now.

Finally, you can access the container terminal using the Visual Studio command palette and selecting

```shell
> Docker Containers: Attach Shell > iut-laravel > iut:latest
```


### Create the project root
Your Laravel app code **must** be in the `laravel` directory which is the default place for a terminal within the container. 
Use the following command lines to initiate it.

```shell
composer create-project laravel/laravel .
```

This command will create all files and install dependencies using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

Once itâ€™s done, the app should be available at [127.0.0.1](http://127.0.0.1)

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ You can now start build your app!

## Services
In Docker Desktop, you can see three containers in the iut-laravel stack.
- laravel: this is where you application live
- redis: will be used later, see it as a NoSQL database for caching
- mailpit: will be used later too for email development and can be seen at [127.0.0.1:8025](http://127.0.0.1:8025)

## Terminals
To keep peace in your mind, you need to remember there is many terminals to use and each one has a specific purpose.

- system: use it to interact with Git, mount containers. For Windows user, this terminal is the one running in the Ubuntu 24.04 distro
- container: use it to interact with the app and PHP. Ex: `php artisan`, `composer`, ... This one is launched using the VSCode Docker plugin

### Open the container terminal
VSCode with the Docker plugin make it easy to open a terminal within a container by using the command palette and using the `> Docker Containers: Attach Shell` shortcut

To open the command palette, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts
- macOS: **CMD+SHIFT+P**
- Windows: **FN+F1**

### Which terminal?
In VSCode, those terminals can be differentiated by their name and icons.
In the following screenshot, the system terminal is the `zsh` one in the right column and the container one, the `Shell: laravel task`.

> The system terminal name can be different for you according to your environment. Keep in mind the Docker container one will have Shell prefix and a spinner at end
